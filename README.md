AI Prediction Model 

This project addresses the challenge of forecasting water quality in the Southern Bug River, leveraging a dataset that contains historical water quality measurements from 22 monitoring stations over a period of time.

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates one or more water quality indicators (such as pollutant concentrations or a composite quality index) using historical observations from upstream monitoring stations.
